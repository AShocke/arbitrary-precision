An(other) attempt at an Arbitrary Precision program

** Program requires you to work with fixed precision
** First, one creates a workspace and then sets the precision
 	- the precision is not supposed to change after a workspace is created
	- we should implement a way of copying a workspace to a workspace with greater
	   precision, but not the other way around.
** Add a testing class to time the operations.
